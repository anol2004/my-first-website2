# E-commerce Website

This is a simple e-commerce website built using:
- HTML
- CSS
- PHP
- MySQL

The site was hosted locally using XAMPP. It includes product listings, login/signup functionality, and a basic cart layout.

## Project Purpose
This was a self-initiated project to practice frontend and backend skills as part of my web development learning journey.

## How to Run
- Install XAMPP
- Start Apache and MySQL
- Copy the project folder to `htdocs`
- Import the SQL file into phpMyAdmin
- Open browser and go to `localhost/your-folder-name`

This project is based on open-source code, almost everything's made by me with and some modifications for learning purposes.

Enjoy!
